# Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

Bivariate and multivariate analysis are statistical methods used to explore relationships between two or more variables in a dataset. This repository provides tools, techniques, and examples for conducting bivariate and multivariate analysis in Python.

## Overview

Bivariate analysis focuses on analyzing the relationship between two variables, while multivariate analysis extends this to analyze the relationships between three or more variables simultaneously. These analyses help uncover patterns, associations, and dependencies between variables, aiding in data-driven decision-making and hypothesis testing.

## Tools and Libraries

The primary tools and libraries used in this repository include:

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning and statistical modeling.

## Contents

1. **Bivariate Analysis**:
